### TASKS & ACTION ITEMS
 1. Every month, the departmental managers meet to discuss high level issues in the company.
 2. We've got a lot to do today, so let's get started.
 3. The presentation is going to be given by Ms Patricia Reyes, who is a representative of the research company we contracted to carry out the work.
 4. It may also mean that we need to interrupt the first few agenda items, but we'll come back to those.
 5. Lydia, can you warn me if we go beyond 10 minutes on this one?
 6. The fact is IT will have the highest cost attached to this relocation in terms of moving equipment, and I'll also need to bring quite a few contract people to help.
 7. That seemed the fairest way to do it.
 8. Otherwise, as you say, IT is responsible for a large part of the relocation costs.
 9. So do you mean in any IT cost related to say, marketing, will be covered by the marketing budget?
 10. Lydia, could you bring Miss Rear some, please?
 11. Yes, I will do.

### ISSUES, RISKS & COSTS
 1. I am a bit concerned about working with the system of core hours and the inflexible hours.
 2. So the up and coming board meeting, we don't need to spend too much time on this, but there are one or two issues which we need to be aware of.
 3. So right, moving on to item 3 and the cost breakdown for the relocation.
 4. Well, I have allocated some of the costs to the budgets of other departments.
 5. Now, my understanding is that Maya has tried to allocate the relocation costs across departments as far as is possible.
 6. But that Matt feels that IT is still taking too many costs.

### LOGISTICS & SCHEDULE
 1. Markis is leading this month's meeting.
 2. Has everyone got a copy of the agenda?
 3. The Ms Reyes will arrive at 1130, so I plan to break out about 1115 to give her time to set up.
 4. No? Maya, I'm aware that flexible working hours has a particular impact on some of your team.
 5. Do you agree with Maya that we need to look through the proposal in more detail first?
 6. Well, I'm sure we can return to it next month's meeting.
 7. Now, Maya, thank you very much for emailing the current figures to all of us.
 8. Maya, is there anything that you want to add before I open this up for questions?
 9. Are there any questions arising from Maya's report?
 10. Can we continue this discussion after lunch?
 11. But before we take a break, I just want to summarize where we are so far.
 12. Let's take a break now.

### CONTEXT & NOTES
 1. Markis White is the Managing Director of Quartz Power Group, an energy company.
 2. Thank you very much for being here on time.
 3. Okay, can I draw your attention to item 4, where it says presentation of online survey results?
 4. And lastly, I'd like to leave a little bit of time under any other business to discuss whatever might come out of the presentation.
 5. Okay, so item 1 is relocation and plans for flexible working.
 6. Now, as you know, Paul and his team have been working on plans to extend flexible working hours across the company.
 7. So Paul, perhaps I can begin by asking you to fill us in on your progress.
 8. Thank you very much indeed, Paul.
 9. I'm on behalf of everyone.
 10. I'd like to say thank you to you and to your team for all the hard work that you've put in so far on this project.
 11. Before we move on to item 2, are there any comments anyone has, anyone would like to make on item 1?
 12. Do you have any thoughts on that?
 13. Well, from my point of view what Paul is proposing sounds fine.
 14. But I think we all need time to read through Paul's proposal in more detail before discussing it any further.
 15. And what do other people think?
 16. Are we all okay to move on to the next point?
 17. So those two people will be replacing the two members of the board who are leaving us.
 18. And that's everything I think on item 2.
 19. I hope that we've all had time to look at them, to read them through.
 20. Nothing's changed since it was sent out as far as I know.
 21. Matt, you look as if you might have a question.
 22. Yes, I suppose I do.
 23. Well, it's more of a comment, really.
 24. But the figures in here don't seem to be the same as the estimates I gave you.
 25. It's all going to require a lot of overtime in my department.
 26. Look, this might help clarify it.
 27. You see, I've broken the IT department up into segments.
 28. The lady from the research company is waiting to join us and to present her results.
 29. And can we all be back here promptly at 11.30 to continue where we left off?
